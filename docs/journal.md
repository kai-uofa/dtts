### Tech-stack and project setup

I decided to use Node.js, Express and TypeScript to build this api. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. Node.js as it's free, open-sourced and cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment which makes it easy for running this project on any operating systems.
2. Express is a "Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)" which will help me to create a robust API quickly.
3. I had worked with Express before and quite comfortable with the structure of an Express project.
4. I have not had exprience with TypeScript before. However, I have head so many good thing about TypeScript so I decided to give it a try. It may take a bit of time to setup and get familiar with the syntax but I believe everything will be paid off later.

Today's goals are:
* Setup the project boiler plate using "express-generator"
* Setup TypeScript correctly.
* Have everything ready for development.
